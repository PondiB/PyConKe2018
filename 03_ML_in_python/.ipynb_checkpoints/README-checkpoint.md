# Installation Notes and Requirements

The tutorial code should be compatible to both Python 2.7 and Python 3.x. but will require recent installations of

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org)
- [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [IPython](http://ipython.readthedocs.org/en/stable/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org)
- [watermark](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/watermark)


To install these libraries it's most convenient to either use [conda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) or [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), e.g.,

    conda install numpy

or

    pip install numpy

etc.
